# Simple Case for C2C-64

It is recommended to use a case to protect the electronics of the C2C-64 from potential shorts that could result in permanent damage. This folder contains a simple case design to this end. The case is made up of two parts, bottom and top. The bottom part is enough to give good protection to the board. To insert the board on the bottom part, first push the side with the 3xRCA output and make sure that the minijack connector on the bottom side fits in the appropriate hole in the case. Then, gently press on the opposite side of the board, slightly pressing the buttons so they don't block the board on its way down. After this procedure is finished, the board will be firmly attached to the case.

There are 3 top case examples provided:
- A simple design without space for OLED screen or C2C logo
- A second design, with support for the OLED screen but no logo
- A third design, with support for the OLED screen and logo
